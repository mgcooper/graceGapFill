This repo is an implementation of the GRACE gap-filling algorithm in the reference below. 

The example run script distributed with that repo was repackaged into a function in util/fillGrace.m

Some of the original code was reformatted to read easier and some comments were added.

Otherwise it should be identical to the files that came from the reference below.
