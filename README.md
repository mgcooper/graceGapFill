# Gap Fill GRACE Missing Data

This repo is an implementation of the GRACE gap-filling algorithm in the reference below. 

The example run script distributed with that repo was repackaged into a function graceGapFill.m

The actual algorithm (and original code) is in code/. 

Some of the original code was reformatted to read easier and some comments were added.

Otherwise it should be identical to the files that came from the reference below.

Usage: see runGraceGapFill.m for an example of how I used the algorithm.
